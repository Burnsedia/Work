I have started the process of Going Pro. Going Pro, is the process of taking your passion and making it your life's perpus. I chose to go pro because of I have been depressed and stressed. I have been going about my life without a strong perpus in mind.

I have chosen the field of Software Engineering and Art to be my life long career. I found my life calling when I was a child, but this field is so large, I have deside to fucuse on native mobile and IOT development, but I will still learn Full Stack Web development, But I will start with Vuejs as my frontend framework of chose
