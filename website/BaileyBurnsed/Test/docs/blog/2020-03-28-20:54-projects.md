**Note** - I am always programming and not all the projects are in the final state, actualy I do not think any are.


### [Make A Wish - Infinit Wish Board][1]

I am currently Contributing to the Make A Wish, Infinite Wish Board Project.

It is a MERN Stack application and I am currently installing Helment.js for security.
Helment.js is a framework that is meant to prevent code and command injection attacks, very important in the world we live in.
